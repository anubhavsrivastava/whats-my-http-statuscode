			"`POST` a representation of the status of, or results obtained from, the action;",
			"`PUT` `DELETE` a representation of the status of the action;",

			"`TRACE` a representation of the request message as received by the end server.",
			"Aside from responses to CONNECT, a 200 response always has a payload, though an origin server MAY generate a payload body of zero length. If no payload is desired, an origin server ought to send 204 No Content instead. For CONNECT, no payload is allowed because the successful result is a tunnel, which begins immediately after the 200 response header section.",
